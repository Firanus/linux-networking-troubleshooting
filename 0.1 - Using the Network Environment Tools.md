# 0.1 - Using the Network Environment Interface Tools

In this lesson, we'll look at the tools we can use to find important information about our network. These include `ifconfig`, `ip` and `nmcli`.

## Terms

### MAC Address

A MAC (or Media Access Control) address is an address that is used to uniquely identify which device is which inside you local network.

Your router keeps track of all these MAC addresses and then uses them to assign a private IP address to each device. Normally these start `192.168.XXX.XXX`. That's why you normally type those numbers in to access your router's control panel in a browser.

These are very different to the public IP addresses that the rest of the internet uses to identify your network as a whole.

Having both MAC addresses and private IP addresses to identify your devices is important, because they have different domains. MAC addresses are often hardcoded right into the device, and never change. Private IP addresses, on the other hand, are assigned by routers, and can thus be changed by the router. These different cases result in correspondingly different uses, which we won't go into here, but include things like enabling and disabling specific pieces of hardware (e.g. to ensure you're modem is the only one getting the internet you paid for)

Spoofing a MAC address is also possible, e.g. for privacy reasons.

### IP Address

An IP address is just an address that is used by network enabled devices to transfer data from one device to another.

As stated in the previous section, different devices canhave different addresses depending on what they're communicating with. So while your network might have an IP address that's publicly accessible over the internet, the devices on your home network will have different private addresses. This is part of a system called NAT (Network Address Translation), which was invented to deal with the fact that we we're slowly running out of IP addresses.

### Subnet (or Net Mask)

This is a piece of information that applies context to your IP address, and defines the size of the network. It seperates your IP into a network and a host address. 

To give an example. if we had a machine with IP address `10.1.1.2` with a mask of the form `255.255.255.0`, this could be interpreted as *if you have to hit an IP address that starts with `10.1.1` and ends with any other number, try to hit it directly on your local network. Otherwise, go to the network gateway and ask it to hit it*. If we had a mask of the form `255.255.0.0`, the behaviour would be similar, but you would try to hit any IP address that started `10.1` locally.

### Gateway

The connection that leads outside of the local network. This is where your devices send data packets that need to go to the internet at large.

### DNS Host

This is a server that takes hostnames and translates them into IP addresses.

### DNS Domain

The lookup domain for the host.

## Accessing the information

Depending on the system you're running, the commands you'll use to access this data will vary. On a Mac, `ifconfig` does the job. On a CentOS Linux machine, this command is now obsolete and has been replaced by `ip addr` and `ip link`.

Note that all of these commands will show you a loopback interface, in addition to others. This is a virtual network that a host uses to communicate with itself, and will always be kicking around.
